# Welcome to my First Website!!
Built a LandingPage completly designed and coded from scratch by me.

## Explanation
* I used `HTML` to build MY desired structure of the site.

* Then used `CSS` to get the look that I wanted.

* Then I used some `JavaScript` magic to do some cool interaactive stuff to the webite :)

* All bult completely from scrach by me

###### PS: took me 8 consecutive hours to build this :)

# What's Implemented 
## Interface and Architecture
* The project's structure looks like this
```
css<br>
- styles.css
index.html
js
- app.js
README.md
```
* All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
* Styling has been added for active states.
* There are 4 sections that have been added to the page.

## Landing Page Behavior
* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. 
* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the appropriate section.
* Added some cool animations using `CSS` and `JS`, see if you can spot them all ;)

## Documentation</li>
* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
